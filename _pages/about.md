Hi. I'm David Fan, a computer science - cognitive science double major at Case Western Reserve University focusing on artificial intelligence and software development. I've been programming for as long as I can remember and I've probably been in love with technology even longer.

This site mainly serves as my personal site/porfolio, but I'm also using it to jot down some thoughts now and then. I've heard being a social developer is a good thing or something like that, and I've never kept a blog/diary/journal before so I'm giving it a try.

Feel free to reach out to me through any of my social links, or if you see me in person at Case or my hometown of Buffalo, New York say hello!
