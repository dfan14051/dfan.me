The site is hosted on a digital ocean droplet that I set up as practice with server administration for being a Hacker Society server admin at Case Western.

The server runs Ubuntu 16.04.02 and serves webpages using Nginx.

This site serves as my personal website with my portfolio, resume, and blog.

Continuous integration for the site is powered by a simple Sinatra app deployed by unicorn on the server that responds to a GitHub webhook.
