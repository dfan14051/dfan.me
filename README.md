# dfan.me
The site is hosted on a digital ocean droplet that I set up as practice with server administration for being a [Hacker Society](http://hacsoc.org/) server admin at Case Western Reserve University.

The server runs Ubuntu 16.04.02 and serves webpages using Nginx.

This site serves as my personal website with my portfolio, resume, and blog.

Continuous integration for the site is powered by a simple Sinatra app that responds to a GitHub post-merge webhook.

Site powered by Jekyll. Theme is [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

# Update
Site is no longer live as I ran out of student Digital Ocean credit.

(8/15/18) I'm deprecating this codebase in favor of a simpler, GitHub Pages powered site for my research blog.
## Todo
Migrate site to GitHub pages
